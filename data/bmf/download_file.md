## Business Master File Data

Business master file data must be downloaded into the bmf folder to operate the Fetch.R script. These extracts are continuously updated and are found at [this link](https://www.irs.gov/charities-non-profits/exempt-organizations-business-master-file-extract-eo-bmf).

Use the Start.R script to download and update business master file data automatically.
