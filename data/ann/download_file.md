## Annual Extract Data

Annual extract data must be downloaded into the ann folder to operate the Fetch.R script. These extracts may be continuously updated and are found at [this link](https://www.irs.gov/statistics/soi-tax-stats-annual-extract-of-tax-exempt-organization-financial-data).

The script currently only supports standard Form 990 extracts (not EZ/PF), and it is not recommended to download any files for years prior to your source year for index data. Files should be formatted with the name "YY_990.dat". A selection of previously saved extracts can be downloaded from [this Google Drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1s9nkFCQg5V3t6LVrdQAWhb6GOp6zcWtX?usp=sharing).
