## XML Indices

XML indices must be downloaded into the xml folder to operate the Fetch.R script. These extracts are continuously updated and are found in the [IRS 990 AWS database](https://docs.opendata.aws/irs-990/readme.html):

> Index listings of available filings are available in JSON and CSV files, organized based on the year they were filed. Index files exist for each year going back to 2013 and are named based on their year and file type. For example, the CSV index for 2013 is available at <https://s3.amazonaws.com/irs-form-990/index_2013.csv>.

Use the Start.R script to download and update XML index data automatically.
